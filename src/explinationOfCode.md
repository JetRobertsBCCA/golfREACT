Code Breakdown
javascript
Copy code
// src/components/GameBoard.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Ball from './Ball';
import Hole from './Hole';
import './GameBoard.css';

const GameBoard = () => {
  const [ballPosition, setBallPosition] = useState({ x: 50, y: 300 });
  const [isAiming, setIsAiming] = useState(false);
  const [aim, setAim] = useState({ angle: 0, power: 0 });
  const [gameOver, setGameOver] = useState(false);

  const handleMouseDown = (e) => {
    setIsAiming(true);
  };

  const handleMouseUp = (e) => {
    if (isAiming) {
      const rect = e.target.getBoundingClientRect();
      const mouseX = e.clientX - rect.left;
      const mouseY = e.clientY - rect.top;
      const dx = mouseX - ballPosition.x;
      const dy = mouseY - ballPosition.y;
      const angle = Math.atan2(dy, dx);
      const power = Math.min(Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy) / 10, 50);

      setAim({ angle, power });
      setIsAiming(false);
      shootBall(angle, power);
    }
  };

  const shootBall = (angle, power) => {
    const velocity = {
      x: Math.cos(angle) * power,
      y: Math.sin(angle) * power,
    };

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setBallPosition((prev) => {
        const newX = prev.x + velocity.x * 0.1;
        const newY = prev.y + velocity.y * 0.1;

        velocity.x *= 0.98; // Apply friction to X velocity
        velocity.y *= 0.98; // Apply friction to Y velocity

        if (Math.abs(velocity.x) < 0.5 && Math.abs(velocity.y) < 0.5) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          checkWin(newX, newY);
          return { x: newX, y: newY };
        }

        return { x: newX, y: newY };
      });
    }, 20);
  };

  const checkWin = (x, y) => {
    const holeX = 450;
    const holeY = 300;
    const distance = Math.sqrt((x - holeX) ** 2 + (y - holeY) ** 2);
    if (distance < 20) {
      setGameOver(true);
    }
  };

  const resetGame = () => {
    setBallPosition({ x: 50, y: 300 });
    setGameOver(false);
  };

  return (
    <div
      className="game-board"
      onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
      onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
    >
      <Ball position={ballPosition} />
      <Hole />
      {gameOver && (
        <div className="game-over">
          <h2>You Win!</h2>
          <button onClick={resetGame}>Play Again</button>
        </div>
      )}
      {isAiming && (
        <div
          className="aim-line"
          style={{
            left: ballPosition.x,
            top: ballPosition.y,
            // Future implementation: Draw aiming line based on mouse position
          }}
        >
          {/* Optional: Implement aiming visuals */}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

<details> <summary><strong>3. `Ball.js`</strong></summary>
Purpose
Ball.js represents the golf ball within the game. It visually displays the ball's position based on the ballPosition prop received from the GameBoard component.

Code Breakdown
javascript
Copy code
// src/components/Ball.js

import React from 'react';
import './Ball.css';

const Ball = ({ position }) => {
  return (
    <div
      className="ball"
      style={{
        left: position.x,
        top: position.y,
      }}
    ></div>
  );
};

export default Ball;
Imports:

React: Core React library.
Ball.css: Styles specific to the Ball component.
Props:

position: An object containing x and y coordinates indicating the ball's current position on the game board.
Rendering:

Returns a <div> with the class name ball.
Inline styles dynamically set the left and top CSS properties based on the position prop, positioning the ball within the game board.
Key Points
Stateless Component: Ball does not manage its own state; it relies entirely on props passed from the parent GameBoard component.
Dynamic Positioning: Utilizes inline styles to position the ball accurately on the game board.
Reusability: Designed to be reusable for any number of balls or positions if the game is expanded.
